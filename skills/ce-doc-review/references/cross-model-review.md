Runs ce-doc-review's **conditional judgment lenses** through one separately routed model target in read-only, least-privilege processes. Each peer gets the **same** persona brief the in-process reviewer uses, returns the same `findings-schema.json` shape, and folds into synthesis as reviewer `<reviewer-name>-<provider>`. It counts as independent corroboration and can promote agreement only when its receipt records `independence_verified: true`; otherwise it remains attributed review evidence without a promotion bonus.

The trio is the three **conditional** judgment lenses whose output diverges most across model families: `adversarial-document-reviewer`, `product-lens-reviewer`, `security-lens-reviewer`. The convergent lenses (`coherence`, `scope-guardian`) and the always-on `feasibility` lens do **not** run cross-model — feasibility is excluded specifically so the pass stays conditional and does not spawn on every review.

The host resolves and sanctions one concrete route before egress; the bundled **`scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh`** enforces that fixed route, composes the prompt, applies least privilege, captures schema-shaped JSON, and normalizes identity receipts. The pass is non-blocking: a failed route writes no fold-in artifact and never switches recipients internally.

## Gate — run only when this holds

Run the cross-model pass for a given trio lens **only when that lens was activated** for this document by the normal Phase 1 persona-selection logic. No new activation triggers are introduced: a routine plan with validated upstream provenance and no high-stakes domain activates none of the trio, so it gets no cross-model pass. The document is already guaranteed readable on disk by Phase 1's missing-document gate — there is no diff and no remote-scope concern, so no additional scope gate is needed.

## Step 1 — Attest host identity, then sanction one fixed route

Keep four identities separate: requested **target**, CLI **harness/intermediary**, serving **family/provider**, and served model. `cursor` means `cursor-agent` with its configured default/Auto model and therefore has no `--model` flag. `composer` means an explicit Composer-family model through `cursor-agent`. `grok` prefers the native Grok CLI; Grok through Cursor is a different route and recipient even though the requested target remains Grok.

Attest both the host harness and its serving family:

```bash
if [ "${CLAUDECODE:-}" = "1" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=claude; XHOST_FAMILY=claude;
elif [ -n "${CODEX_SANDBOX:-}${CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED:-}${CODEX_SESSION_ID:-}${CODEX_THREAD_ID:-}${CODEX_CI:-}" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=codex; XHOST_FAMILY=codex;
elif [ -n "${CURSOR_AGENT:-}${CURSOR_CONVERSATION_ID:-}" ]; then XHOST_HARNESS=cursor; XHOST_FAMILY=unknown;
else XHOST_HARNESS=unknown; XHOST_FAMILY=unknown; fi
```

Pass `XHOST_HARNESS` as `CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS`; pass `XHOST_FAMILY` as the first worker argument. Claude Code maps to harness/family `claude`; Codex maps to `codex`. Cursor maps to harness `cursor` and family `unknown` unless an observable serving-family attestation lets you set `XHOST_FAMILY` to `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, or `composer`. An unknown host family cannot satisfy automatic same-family exclusion, so skip the automatic cross-model pass. Never infer serving family from the Cursor brand.

Resolve the preference in this order:

1. A preference the user **states in conversation** (e.g. "use grok for the cross-model pass").
2. `cross_model_peer:` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` (the only file the script/skill reads for this).
3. A preference already in your **project instructions** (the active instructions in your context) — consumed from context, **never** read from a named file.
4. **Default:** first available attested-different target in `codex → claude → grok → composer`; Cursor-default participates only when explicitly preferred.

Before content egresses, resolve each selected target to one concrete installed route, verify every recipient against `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS`, announce it, and pass it as `CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE`. A failed dispatched route returns no artifact; it never changes provider or intermediary internally. A retry is a new host decision and requires disclosure/sanction before dispatch. For backward compatibility, either `cursor` or `composer` in `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` sanctions Cursor as an intermediary, but selecting a Cursor-default voice itself requires target `cursor`; `grok` alone never sanctions Grok-via-Cursor.

Preferred model mappings run first. Only after the preferred ID is observed unavailable, obsolete, or incompatible may the host inspect current CLI capabilities and choose the closest compatible **same-target/same-family** replacement. Bind it with both `CROSS_MODEL_MODEL_OVERRIDE_TARGET=<target>` and `CROSS_MODEL_MODEL_OVERRIDE=<model-id>`. Never substitute across families, apply one target's override to another route, silently change an explicit model, or add a recipient.

## Step 2 — Provider model + reasoning tier (owned by the script)

所有 activated lenses 都使用**每个 provider 一个 high reasoning model，Codex 例外使用 extra-high**（composer 的 `-fast` tier 是其 ceiling，属于允许的例外）。具体 model IDs 和各 route reasoning flags 位于 script 的**单一 mapping**中（`scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh`、`M_CODEX`/`M_CLAUDE`/`M_GROK`/`M_GROK_CURSOR`/`M_COMPOSER` constants 和 `adapter_argv` builder）。本 reference 有意**不**重复 IDs；单一事实来源可防止 reference 与 script 漂移。IDs 是 tier principle 当前实例（单一维护点），不是 contract。

The **persona file** basename and the **reviewer name** are distinct: the script reads the brief from `references/personas/<persona-file>.md` but forces the fold-in `reviewer` field to `<reviewer-name>-<provider>` so agreement matches the in-process persona's short name. The script derives the persona-file from the allowlisted reviewer-name — it is **not** a caller argument, so no caller value reaches the brief-read path.

## Step 3 — Announce

- **Interactive host，默认（non-headless）mode：** 展示一行**醒目且独立的文字**，把它描述为 judgment lenses 的**独立 cross-model review**（使用 "cross-model" / "independent model"，不要使用内部 "peer" 术语）；点明 script 内 mapping 中的具体 **model 和 reasoning level**（例如 GPT-5.6-luna extra-high reasoning、Opus high、Grok 4.5 high、Composer 2.5-fast）；并且因为两个不同 models 可能通过*同一个* `cursor-agent` CLI 到达，对 cursor-agent routes 要同时写明 **route 和 model**，使 Grok-4.5-via-cursor-agent、Composer-via-cursor-agent、Grok-4.5-via-the-grok-CLI 清楚可辨；还要**声明完整 document content 会发送给该 provider**（third-party egress；cursor-agent routes 的 egress 是 Cursor *加上* serving provider）。**Announce wording 遵循 receipt：** 只有 route 带有 served-model receipt 时，才能把某个 model 称为 serving；receipt-less route 应写 "requested <model>; serving model unverified on this route"，不能断言具体 model。公告与 Phase 2 team announce 放在一起，不要埋在其后。措辞由你决定，但可验证的 requirements 是：醒目、明确是 **cross-model reviewer**（不是 generic persona）、点明 requested model（receipt-less route 带 unverified marker）、cursor-agent 时点明 route、点明 egress。示例：`Cross-model pass：judgment lenses 也由独立 model review；requested **Grok 4.5（high reasoning），via cursor-agent**（serving model 在该 route 上未验证）。完整 document content 会发送给 xAI/Cursor。`
  - Call the pass **independent** only when host and target serving families are attestably different. For Cursor default/Auto or an unknown host family, call it a cross-harness review and state that independence is unverified; do not promise agreement promotion before the receipt exists.
  - Announce the one fixed route and every recipient before dispatch. A route failure produces no artifact and may be retried only after the host resolves, sanctions, and discloses the new route. Reconcile `cross_model_target`, `cross_model_harness`, `cross_model_route`, `model_requested`, and `model_actual` from the artifact; never infer a serving model from the requested ID.
- **Interactive host, no peer resolved** (host un-attestable, or no different provider installed/authed): one quiet line that the cross-model pass was skipped and why. Never an error.
- **Headless mode:** emit no user-facing prose. The script still emits a one-line stderr audit log per send that document content was sent cross-model to the named provider, so the third-party data egress is auditable even though the pass is silent to the user. Headless still requires a reachable peer under the normal gates; an explicit `cross_model_peer:` in `.compound-engineering/config.local.yaml` or a non-empty `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` allowlist is the preferred enablement surface when teams want fail-closed-by-default CI egress (unset allowlist still means the default availability order).

## Step 4 — Run the bundled script (one call per activated trio lens, in parallel with the persona reviewers)

Each call is a CLI shell-out, not a subagent. Resolve one target and one fixed route once per document review, then launch every activated lens against that same sanctioned target/route. Launch each call as a detached job through `scripts/peer-job-runner.py` in the same dispatch wave as the in-process reviewers. A failed route does not fall through inside the worker.

**Two modes — slice the trio, sweep the whole doc (R20, KTD6):**

- **Trio peers, sliced.** On **unified artifacts**, pass each activated trio lens the *same reviewer-specific slice its in-process twin got* as `<document-path>` (write that slice to a temp file — e.g. product-lens/adversarial get the Product Contract), not the full document, so the peer is a true corroborating twin rather than an off-lens reviewer. On legacy docs the peer gets the same full document the twin does.
- **One whole-doc sweep.** In the **same wave**, also launch **one** call with reviewer-name **`whole-doc`**, the **full** document (never sliced), and the same resolved provider — a broad different-model read of the entire doc. It runs **once per document** (not per lens), writes `whole-doc-<provider>.json`, and folds in as an independent reviewer that corroborates by fingerprint against *any* in-process finding (it has no in-process twin). Same gate, isolation, and non-blocking rules as the trio calls. A model following this contract MUST issue this `whole-doc` invocation whenever the pass runs, or the broad coverage R20/U9 promises is silently skipped.

Invoke via the skill-dir anchor — set `SKILL_DIR` to the absolute directory of **this** skill's `SKILL.md` (the Bash tool's CWD is the user's project, not the skill dir, on every host; shell state does not persist between Bash calls, so set it inline in every runner call):

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-doc-review SKILL.md you read>";
SCRATCH_ROOT="/tmp/compound-engineering-$(id -u)";
if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "unsafe scratch root symlink: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
install -d -m 700 "$SCRATCH_ROOT" || exit 1;
if [ -L "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ] || [ ! -O "$SCRATCH_ROOT" ]; then echo "scratch root is not owned by the current user: $SCRATCH_ROOT" >&2; exit 1; fi;
chmod 700 "$SCRATCH_ROOT" || exit 1;
RUN_DIR="$SCRATCH_ROOT/ce-doc-review/<run-id>"; (umask 077; mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR") || exit 1; chmod 700 "$RUN_DIR" || exit 1;
CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS="<host-harness>" CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE="<fixed-route>" python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" start --skill ce-doc-review --run-id "<run-id>" --label "<reviewer-name>" -- env CROSS_MODEL_HOST_HARNESS="<host-harness>" CROSS_MODEL_FIXED_ROUTE="<fixed-route>" bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/cross-model-doc-review.sh" "<host-serving-family>" "<target>" "<reviewer-name>" "<document-path>" "<document-type>" "<origin>" "$RUN_DIR"
```

Omit `--result-path`; `done` means only that the worker exited. The fixed target determines the expected `<reviewer-name>-<target>.json` filename.

- `<host-serving-family>` is `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `composer`, or `unknown`; `<host-harness>` is `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `cursor`, or `unknown`.
- `<target>` is exactly one of `codex`, `claude`, `grok`, `cursor`, or `composer`; `<fixed-route>` is its already-sanctioned route (`grok-cli` and `grok-cursor` remain distinct).
- `<reviewer-name>` = the activated lens (`security-lens`, `adversarial`, or `product-lens`). The script derives the persona-brief filename and (per provider) model from this allowlisted value — the brief path is never caller-controlled.
- `<document-path>` = the document under review.
- `<document-type>` = the Phase 1 classification (`requirements` / `plan` / `unified-requirements` / `unified-plan`).
- `<origin>` = the same `{origin_path}` slot the in-process personas receive.
- `<run-dir>` = the absolute `$RUN_DIR` resolved above. The script writes `<reviewer-name>-<provider>.json` there per resolved peer **only after** forcing `reviewer` to `<reviewer-name>-<provider>` and downgrading peer `safe_auto` → `gated_auto`.

Every runner call is bounded — no tool call ever spans a worker's runtime, on any host. Between dispatch waves, poll outstanding jobs (it returns early when the watched jobs settle):

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing the ce-doc-review SKILL.md you read>";
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" wait --max-secs 30 --json <job-ids...>
```

最后一次 `start` 后立即捕获 epoch time（`date +%s`）；其他机制不会跨 tool calls 跟踪 wall clock，因此需要该 anchor 判断 deadline。Synthesis 时，循环执行 bounded `wait` calls，直到所有 jobs 进入 terminal，或从最后一次 `start` 起已过 **610 秒**（每个 slice 前用 `date +%s` 与 anchor 比较；不要启动会超过 deadline 的 `wait` slice，应改为 reap）。达到 deadline 时，对仍 nonterminal 的每个 job 执行 `reap`，再运行最后一次 bounded `wait --max-secs 10` pass（reap 是异步的，terminal record 会在返回后一段 grace period 落地），然后纳入 `<run-dir>` 中存在的所有 `<reviewer-name>-<provider>.json` files。Detached script 仍自带边界（codex idle-timeout 默认 480s，并强制 reasoning 以维持 liveness；hard backstop `CROSS_MODEL_HARD_SECS` 默认 600s）并干净退出；runner supervisor windows 位于这些 caps 之外，作为 backstop。无需向 script 传 prompt 或 schema；它会从 disk 读取 persona brief、`findings-schema.json` 和 document 本身。

Any started job whose terminal state is not `done` (`failed` / `timeout` / `died-without-result` — a job reaped at the deadline records `timeout`, with the reap noted in its reason; a preflight failure never yields a job id — a genuine gate-not-met skip is the silent `never-started` case, but a dispatch-infrastructure crash before any job starts is not a clean skip and triggers the hand-recovery rule in Step 5) is named in the Coverage line with its lens and terminal state (e.g. "cross-model security-lens peer: timeout"); silent absence remains correct only for passes that were never started (gate not met / skip). A missing fold-in file is still "the pass didn't run for that lens," never a review failure — except when a dispatch-infrastructure crash voided the whole pass at once, which Step 5 handles as named whole-pass loss (the whole-doc broad read especially), not per-lens "not run." After fold-in, delete the consumed job dirs under `<run-dir>/jobs` (use the environment's preferred deletion command).

The cross-model pass does **not** receive the accumulated decision primer that in-process personas get on round 2+ — the peer prompt carries a round-1 framing regardless of round. This is deliberate (cross-model is most valuable on the first pass), and synthesis's own R29/R30 suppression is the authoritative backstop for re-raised or already-resolved findings, so a peer that re-raises a prior-round-rejected finding is dropped at synthesis, not surfaced.

## Step 5 — Fold into synthesis

- Read each fold-in artifact through the runner's verified read — `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peer-job-runner.py" result --path <run-dir>/<reviewer-name>-<target>.json` (fd-ownership-checked, bounded; exit 4 means unreadable -> treat as no file). If present, treat it as one reviewer return with `reviewer: <reviewer-name>-<target>`. It enters ordinary dedup, but enters cross-model agreement promotion **only when `independence_verified` is `true`**. A false or absent value may contribute findings but never raises an anchor. Peer returns never grant silent-apply authority.
- **No file, clean skip** (script skipped before starting real work: host un-attestable, no different provider reachable, CLI missing/unauthed, unparseable output, or lens not activated) → the pass simply didn't run for that lens. Note "cross-model pass: not run" in Coverage on an interactive host in default mode; stay silent in headless mode. Never fail the review. Ignore any `*.raw.json` leftovers — they are not fold-in artifacts.
- **Dispatch-infrastructure failure vs. clean skip.** The clean skip above is a script that *chose* not to start real work. A dispatch-infrastructure crash is different — the runner or worker itself failed: a non-zero exit before any job starts, a preflight/detach failure, or an unresolved `$SKILL_DIR`/script path. Because every leg shares one runner, route, and `$SKILL_DIR`, such a crash typically drops the **whole** cross-model pass at once, not one lens. Do not fold it into the silent skip on the first error: re-run the **same resolved route** by hand — re-issuing the affected `start` calls with the target/model, the tool-less empty-scratch isolation posture, and the embedded-document read scope all held fixed — while each failure is a new, plausibly recoverable one and the shared 610s deadline holds (a same-route retry, distinct from the quota rule below, which requires a newly disclosed route). Stop and drop the cross-model pass once a failure repeats or the deadline is spent. Each trio lens is still covered by its in-process twin; what an infra crash silently voids is the **whole-doc broad read** (the sweep leg has no twin) plus cross-model corroboration — name that loss in the Coverage line rather than letting it disappear as "not run." A hand recovery may not substitute a different target or provider, widen the read scope beyond the embedded document, or relax the read-only empty-scratch posture.
- **Started but not `done`** (the job's final state is `failed` / `timeout` / `died-without-result`) → still non-blocking, but never silent: name the lens and terminal state in Coverage per Step 4's naming rule.
- **删除 job dirs 前先归类 skip reason。** Peer 没有产生可用 output 或以 non-`done` 结束时，cleanup 前读取 `out.log`，包括以 `peer skip evidence:` 开头的有界行。明确指出观察到的 quota、authentication 或 capability failure。Authentication-shaped peer failure（`not logged in`、`please log in`、401 或提示登录的 CLI 文本）只描述 peer 的 execution context：sandboxed host，例如限制 spawned commands 访问 network 或 keychain 的 Codex task，会产生与真实 account logout 完全相同的 signal。因此应归类为 cross-model execution-context authentication failure；绝不要据此报告用户 account 已退出登录，或提示用户运行 login command。Cross-model pass 是附加项，in-process reviewers 仍覆盖了各自 lenses；要获取该 pass，需要 peer CLI 能访问 network 的 context（例如 restricted sandbox 之外）。同一 quota 或 usage-limit evidence 在本 session 出现超过一次后，不要自动重试该 route。重试必须使用新解析并已披露的固定 route；绝不静默转向另一个 recipient。
- Empty `findings` → note "cross-model pass: no additional issues" in Coverage.
- A finding sharing a dedup fingerprint with its in-process twin (`<reviewer-name>`) promotes by one anchor step only when the artifact records `independence_verified: true`. Cursor-default artifacts default false; an unattested host skips automatic dispatch. Twin match uses section+title or same section with >50% evidence-substring overlap.

## Trust boundary (maintainers)

The script embeds the **full document content** into the peer prompt and sends it to an external model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, or Cursor, depending on the resolved peer). This is a wider egress than a diff-only review. `CROSS_MODEL_PEERS` restricts which providers may receive content. The peer runs strictly read-only, from an empty scratch run-dir, with no project context — every route denies writes, network, MCP, and subagents. On **reads** the routes split into two tiers: **truly tool-less** — claude (`--safe-mode --tools ""`, all built-in tools disabled and custom behavior suppressed, run from the scratch dir) and grok (`--deny Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash`/`Task`/web/`mcp__*` with `--cwd <scratch>`), which have no read tool at all; and **read-only residual** — codex (`-s read-only -C <scratch>`) and cursor-agent (`--mode ask --sandbox enabled --workspace <scratch>`), which still permit *read* tools (see the accepted residual below). Impact is bounded to disclosure, not repo mutation — and because the reviewed document is the maintainer's own and the host agent already has more repo access than any peer, the read residual adds no material exposure.

**Accepted read residual (codex + cursor-agent routes):** codex (`-s read-only`) and cursor-agent (`--mode ask`) are read-only but retain a *read* tool — codex can also run read-only shell commands and read outside the scratch dir; cursor-agent can Read. Neither can be made truly tool-less (read-only is codex's sandbox floor; ask-mode is cursor-agent's), so they are a weaker isolation posture than the tool-less claude/grok routes. This is an **accepted** risk for ce-doc-review's own-document threat model — the reviewed documents are the maintainer's own planning docs (low injection surface), and the host agent already runs in-repo with strictly more privilege than any peer, so a peer that can read a file the host could already read (and send it to a provider the document already egresses to) adds no materially new exposure. The routes are kept, not fail-closed; the script's stderr audit log records each send so the egress is auditable even in headless mode.
